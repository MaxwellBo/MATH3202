Attention: Maxwell Bo

We are a juice manufacturer that wants to improve how we import frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) for making our products, particularly in the off-season when there is limited local supply in Australia. We currently ship into the ports of Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide. Each of these ports feed our local factories and we can predict the demands (barrels) and costs ($/barrel) involved for each of the next eight quarters:

Quarter	Brisbane	Melbourne	Adelaide	Cost
Q1	1800	2400	3200	$873
Q2	2100	3400	1800	$901
Q3	2500	2800	1700	$1010
Q4	2400	2200	2400	$992
Q5	1750	2500	2500	$1025
Q6	1950	3600	2200	$906
Q7	2600	2950	1850	$1011
Q8	2700	1350	1950	$1013
Each quarter we use a single ship for imports with a capacity of 10,000 barrels. We currently have 3200 barrels of frozen concentrated orange juice in Brisbane, 4000 barrels in Melbourne, and 3800 barrels in Adelaide. We can store any concentrate on hand at the end of a quarter for a cost of $25 per barrel.

Communication 2
Thank you for your initial estimate. We noticed that your schedule will leave us with no frozen concentrate in storage at the end of the eight quarters. We feel it would be desirable to end up with at least 3000 barrels in storage in each port. Could you take this into account in your proposal?

Thank you for your estimate. We will consider your proposal and get back to you soon.
