Thank you for your advice on how to minimise the cost of purchasing our frozen concentrated orange juice for the next eight quarters. We are now looking at our processing operations in Brisbane and would again appreciate your help.

In each quarter we will be using the FCOJ delivered to Brisbane to produce our signature range of Pure Fresh juices, made with fresh local fruit. Each barrel of concentrate can be reconstituted to make 1000 litres of orange juice. We can sell this directly as orange juice or blend it to make other juices, as shown in the following table:

Regular Juices
Orange Juice	100% Orange
Orange and Mango Juice	90% Orange, 10% Mango
Breakfast Juice	55% Apple, 28% Pineapple, 15% Orange, 2% Mango
Tropical Juice	65% Apple, 30% Pineapple, 4% Orange, 1% Passionfruit
Gourmet Juices
Guava Delight	80% Apple, 10% Pineapple, 10% Guava
Orchard Medley	50% Apple, 45% Orange, 5% Mango
Strawberry Surprise	90% Apple, 8% Strawberry, 2% Guava
Thanks to your previous work, the average cost of reconstituted orange juice is $974 per thousand litres (kL). Taking into account purchasing and processing, the costs of the local fruits are as follows:

Fruit	Cost ($/kL)
Apple	620
Mango	1300
Pineapple	800
Passionfruit	1500
Guava	710
Strawberry	1370
The amount of orange juice is limited by the demand we noted for our original shipping schedule into Brisbane. (We reconstitute it and will use it for other products as well, so you do not need to restrict amounts to whole numbers of barrels.) We can obtain any amount of the local fruits at the above prices.

In each quarter we anticipate being able to sell at most the following amounts (kL) of each juice:

Quarter	Q1	Q2	Q3	Q4	Q5	Q6	Q7	Q8
Orange Juice	973	872	1206	981	781	1055	1420	1236
Orange & Mango Juice	311	347	469	389	329	363	484	568
Breakfast Juice	682	707	838	938	586	788	1141	988
Tropical Juice	492	586	726	739	450	549	645	779
Guava Delight	340	459	593	393	276	424	559	389
Orchard Medley	1151	621	697	909	1133	615	542	865
Strawberry Surprise	625	740	468	409	665	750	411	464

Our transport division have advised us that their delivery trucks must always bring full loads of a single local fruit, equivalent to 10 kL of processed juice per truck. Could you take this into account in your cost calculations?

Due to staffing difficulties in manufacturing our gourmet juices (Guava Delight, Orchard Medley, and Strawberry Surprise) we would like to only produce two of these juices each quarter. Could you revise your blending schedule accordingly?
